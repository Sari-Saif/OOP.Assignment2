 "Nice," she said, smacking her lips. "I wish I had a string of sausages to
go with it, though..."
   Instantly she bit her tongue, but too late. Out of the air appeared the
sausages while the woodcutter stuttered with rage.
   ". . . what have you done! Sausages . . . What a stupid waste of a wish!
You foollsh woman. I wish they would stick up your nose!" No sooner sald than
done. For the sausages leapt up and stuck fast to the end of the woman's nose.
This time, the woodcutter's wife flew into a rage.
   "You idiot, what have you done? With all the things we could have wished
for . . ." The mortified woodcutter, who had just repeated his wife's own
mistake, exclaimed:
   "I'd chop . . ." Luckily he stopped himself in time, realizing with horror
that he'd been on the point of having his tongue chopped off. As his wife
complained and blamed him, the poor man burst out laughing.
   "If only you knew how funny you look with those sausages on the end of your
nose!" Now that really upset the woodcutter's wife. She hadn't thought of her
looks. She tried to tug away the sausages but they would not budge. She pulled
again and again, but in vain. The sausages were firmly attached to her nose.
Terrified, she exclaimed: "They'll be there for the rest of my life!"
   Feeling sorry for his wife and wondering how he could ever put up with a
woman with such an awkward nose, the woodcutter said: "I'll try." Grasping the
string of sausages, he tugged with all his might. But he simply pulled his
wife over on top of him. The pair sat on the floor, gazing sadly at each other.
   "What shall we do now?" they said, each thinking the same thought.
   "There's only one thing we can do . . ." ventured the woodcutter's wife
timidly.
