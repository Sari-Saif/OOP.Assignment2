 "Yes, I'm afraid so . . ." her husband sighed, remembering their dreams of
riches, and he bravely wished the third and last wish "I wish the sausages
would leave my wife's nose."
   And they did. Instantly, husband and wife hugged each other tearfully,
saying "Maybe we'll be poor, but we'll be happy again!"
   That evening, the only reminder of the woodcutter's meeting with the elf
was the string of sausages. So the couple fried them, gloomily thinking of
what that meal had cost them.
